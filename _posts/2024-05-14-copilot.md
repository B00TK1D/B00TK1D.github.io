Halfway through my college career I was added to beta access for Github Copilot,
and quickly realized it was capable of writing about 80% of the code for 80%
of my assignments.  Thankfully, I already had a solid foundation of coding,
so I primarily used it for boilerplate and it didn't seriously stunt my growth.

Fast forward two years, and I became interested in automated exploit generation with AI.
Copilot seemed like the natural choice; in my experience, writing a few comments
at the top of a file and letting Copilot generate the rest produced much better results
than ChatGPT.  I strongly dislike pay-per-use APIs, so I didn't want to pay for OpenAI's API
just to play around with an idea.  But it turns out my preference didn't matter, because
API access to OpenAI's Codex model (the model used for Copilot) was deprecated in March 2023.
After some research, I concluded that an API for Github Copilot simply didn't exist.
So I decided to make one.

The first resource I found was this [Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76741410/how-to-invoke-github-copilot-programmatically),
in which someone had almost the same question as me.  It led me to investigate the official
[Copilot Neovim plugin](https://github.com/github/copilot.vim) (Neovim mentioned).
After some some digging, At the time, I had no idea how Neovim or LSPs worked (I've since become
more enlightened with credit to many excellent videos by [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen)).

After some digging, I identified that the plugin consisted of a minified JavaScript agent and
a set of Lua scripts.  By checking my process list with Copilot activated, I saw the command-line
arguments used to start the JavaScript agent:

```bash
root@boot:~# ps -xo cmd | grep copilot
node /root/.config/nvim/pack/github/start/copilot.vim/dist/agent.js --stdio
grep --color=auto copilot
```
{: .nolineno }

The agent seems interesting, so I tried calling it with `--help`:

```bash
root@boot:~# node /root/.config/nvim/pack/github/start/copilot.vim/dist/agent.js --help
Options:
  --help      Show help                                                [boolean]
  --version   Show version number                                      [boolean]
  --stdio     use stdio                                                [boolean]
  --node-ipc  use node-ipc                                             [boolean]
```
{: .nolineno }


Not very helpful.  So to tear this apart a bit more, I decided to try to Man-in-the-Middle the agent.
I threw together a quick javascript program to log all the data passed back and forth to the agent.
There's probably cleaner ways to do this by inspecting linux pipes, but this was the quick and dirty
solution that worked:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

const inLogStream = fs.createWriteStream('copilot-prompts.log', { flags: 'a' });
const outLogStream = fs.createWriteStream('copilot-suggestions.log', { flags: 'a' });

// Replace the path with the absolute path for agent.js
const agentScriptPath =
  '/root/.config/nvim/pack/github/start/copilot.vim/dist/agent.orig.js';

// Spawn a new process running agent.js with the absolute path
const agentProcess = spawn('node', [agentScriptPath]);

// Pipe stdin from the main script to the new process and log it
process.stdin.pipe(inLogStream);
process.stdin.pipe(agentProcess.stdin);

// Pipe stdout from the new process back to the main script's stdout and log it
agentProcess.stdout.pipe(outLogStream);
agentProcess.stdout.pipe(process.stdout);
```

I moved the original `agent.js` to `agent.orig.js`, and replaced it with this script.
I fired up Neovim, tailed the logs, and started capturing requests!

```bash
root@boot:~# tail -f copilot-prompts.log

{"params":{"contentChanges":[{"rangeLength":0,"range":{"start":{"line":3,"character":
  0},"end":{"line":3,"character":0}},"text":" "}],"textDocument":

I added some line breaking to the output to make it slghtly more readable, but basically
what's going on is that the agent serves as a JSON RPC server, providing middleware between
the Lua NeoVim plugin and Github's Copilot API servers.  That's interesting, but I'd
like to interface directly with the API, instead of going through this RPC middleware.

My next step was to analyze the source code for `agent.js`.  However, this source code was
minified, and even after running it through some de-obfuscators it was still pretty large and
difficult to pick apart.  However, a few things jumped out at me after scanning through it.

First, there were some interesting strings that seemed to be part of Copilot's prompt engineering:

```
You are an AI programming assistant.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot".
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
You must refuse to discuss your opinions or rules.
You must refuse to discuss life, existence or sentience.
You must refuse to engage in argumentative discussion with the user.
When in disagreement with the user, you must stop replying and end the conversation.
Your responses must not be accusing, rude, controversial or defensive.
Your responses should be informative and logical.
You should always adhere to technical information.
...
The active document is the source code the user is looking at right now.
You have read access to the code in the active document,
files the user has recently worked with and open tabs.
You are able to retrieve, read and use this code to answer questions.
You cannot retrieve code that is outside of the current project.
You can only give one reply for each conversation turn.
```

(The full prompts that I extracted are available here:
[https://github.com/B00TK1D/copilot-prompts](https://github.com/B00TK1D/copilot-prompts)).

This was very interesting, because it means these prompts were being injected in the client-side,
not server-side.  This is very bad a design/security perspective, but very cool for anyone
that wants to take advantage of it.

Some more interesting strings seemed to indicate that the agent has some control over which GPT
model is used:

```javascript
async function Cy(e, t) {
    var n, s;
    let r = await fWe(e);
    switch (t) {
    case "gpt-3.5-turbo":
        return {
            model: (n = r.gpt35ExpModel) != null ? n : "gpt-3.5-turbo",
            uiName: "GPT-3.5 Turbo",
            maxTokens: 8192,
            maxRequestTokens: 6144,
            maxResponseTokens: 2048,
            baseTokensPerMessage: 4,
            baseTokensPerName: -1,
            baseTokensPerCompletion: 3
        };
    case "gpt-4": {
        let {
            maxTokens: o,
            maxRequestTokens: a,
            maxResponseTokens: c
        } = await lWe(e);
        return {
            model: (s = r.gpt4ExpModel) != null ? s : "gpt-4",
            uiName: "GPT-4",
            maxTokens: o,
            maxRequestTokens: a,
            maxResponseTokens: c,
            baseTokensPerMessage: 3,
            baseTokensPerName: 1,
            baseTokensPerCompletion: 3
        }
    }
}
```

I left this strings alone for now, and move on to one last interesting piece of code:

```javascript

async function nGe(e) {
    return {
        name: "Reachability",
        items: {
            "github.com":
              await EO(e, "https://github.com"),
            "copilot-proxy.githubusercontent.com":
              await EO(e, "https://copilot-proxy.githubusercontent.com/_ping"),
            "api.githubcopilot.com":
              await EO(e, "https://api.githubcopilot.com/_ping"),
            "default.exp-tas.com":
              await EO(e, "https://default.exp-tas.com/vscode/ab")
        }
    }
}
```

This provides some indication of the urls that the agent is likely reaching out to.

The analysis that followed was a bit non-linear and had several dead-ends.
I tried modifying the URLs to point to my own server so I could log the requests to try to
replicate them, but this failed because the agent was using some sort of SSL enforcement.
(I later learned there was a simple environment variable I could set to disable this,
but I didn't know that at the time).  The solution I settled on was a sort of double nginx
proxy, which used letsencrypt SSL certs to listen on HTTPS, forwarded traffic through to the second
proxy over HTTP (with tcpdump running in between), and then the second proxy forwarded traffic
to the original destination.  When I later re-created my analysis, I made better decisions,
and instead used [mitmproxy](https://mitmproxy.org/), which is a much better tool for the job
(and what I used for the screenshots below).


The protocol used by the agent is relatively straight-forward.  When it is first launched,
it sends an authentication request to `api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token`, using a
static Github auth token which is generated when the user first signs into the Copilot extension.
(As a side note, this auth token has maximum permissions on every Github resource for the user
and as far as I can tell never expires, so it would be a valuable target for token stealing.)

![Auth Request](/assets/img/posts/05-15-2024/auth-request.png)

The auth request returns a bearer token, which is valid for 30 minutes.

![Auth Response](/assets/img/posts/05-15-2024/auth-response.png)

After initial auth, all subsequent requests are sent to
`https://api.githubcopilot.com/v1/engines/copilot-codex/completions`.
Interestingly, the parameters for this endpoint mirrored those of the official OpenAI API
very closely.  Suspiciously closely.  I'll come back to this shortly.

![Completion Request](/assets/img/posts/05-15-2024/completion-request.png)

The return value from this request used HTTP/2.0 streaming to send back a series of possible
completions.

![Completion Response](/assets/img/posts/05-15-2024/completion-response.png)

Replicating the agent's API interface in python was relatively straight-forward, so I threw
together a quick interface, which is now hosted at
[https://github.com/B00TK1D/copilot-api](https://github.com/B00TK1D/copilot-api).
I posted this code a few places, and it seems to have helped a few people out since then.

I had accomplished my original objective, but there were still some unresolved discoveries.
Why were the `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt-4` strings present in the agent?  It turned out, Copilot
had recently rolled out Copilot Chat, which is an VSCode extension that adds a ChatGPT-like
sidebar to VSCode.

With just a little bit of guesswork, I determined that Copilot Chat was actually just GPT-4,
with the special set of prompts I had discovered earlier.  The interesting thing was that
no OpenAI API keys or subscriptions were necessary - Copilot Chat was included for all existing
Copilot subscribers (or students, which get it for free).

After doing more analysis, I determined that the API endpoint at `https://api.githubcopilot.com/chat/completions`
was nothing more than an OpenAI API proxy, with a different auth wrapper (which authenticated
using the Copilot bearer token instead of an OpenAI key).  I could query any model, with nearly
identical behavior to the real OpenAI API.

As a final step, I wrote a basic [command-line interface](https://github.com/B00TK1D/freegpt) for this API, providing a minimalist
equivalent to ChatGPT using GPT-4 in the terminal, authenticated using Github's native
copy-paste browser code system (which I also borrowed from the Copilot agent code).
The best thing is that this is all provided with a Copilot license - no paying for ChatGPT Plus
required.  (If you're really tied to a browser interface, you can also host your own ChatGPT
for free using the same technique, using a [web UI](https://github.com/B00TK1D/freegpt-gui)
I cobbled together.)

All in all, I successfully reverse engineered the Github Copilot Neovim plugin and network API,
wrote my own interface for the API, and ended up with free unlimited API access to GPT-4 as a
nice side benefit.
